##  Abilities

### Enhancer
Enhances one of the abilities the spell is cast on. The greater it is enhanced, the more power is required.

### Complementary Force
Provides the one on who this spell is cast with a completely new ability that complements their most prominent element. Requires much more power than enhancing an already existing ability.

### Shape-shifter
The one on who this spell is cast takes on a different form. Requires a continuous stream of magic, thus she cannot use magic for other things in the meantime. The greater this form differs from the target's original form, the harder it will be to keep the stream going.

### Limitations
*  Shape-shifting does not grant any extra abilities unless they're physically part of the form one has shape-shifted into (e.g. claws).
*  Auxilia can only shape-shift others into forms that would make them about as powerful as they already were.

##  Weaknesses
Because of a powerful kv'naer rune, she can only use magical powers on her allies, which rules out herself or her enemies. She fully relies on others to do her bidding (who could possibly betray her).

##  Motives
*  She wants to dispel the kv'naer rune so she can use her powers freely.
*  She wants to take revenge on those who destroyed her village and imprisoned her parents.

##  History
When she was still very young her village got attacked. For as young as she was, she fought back instead of fleeing to the dismay of her parents.  Alongside her were many, including a powerful mage with his powers only being limited by his old age. It wasn't long before they got outnumbered by the opposing forces and she saw the mage laying down on the floor, beaten up completely. The mage looked in her eyes and, in a last-ditch effort, decided to let her have his powers instead of letting them go to waste, but did so under one condition: that she may only use her powers to help out other people. After doing so, he quickly created a portal that would bring her somewhere safe. She stepped into the portal, but not before witnessing the mage being brutally murdered. The portal closed as she stepped into it.

As such, she can't use her newfound powers on herself or her enemies because of the dead mage's powerful kv'naer rune preventing her from doing so. She must rely on allies, but who's to say they won't turn against her after they have tasted her power flowing through them?

After finally finding out that her parents were imprisoned after having long thought they were dead, she wanted to save them. She couldn't, however, do so on her own. She needed an ally to use her powers on. She hastily looked for anyone that would be willing to help her, and so she eventually did. She gave the man her powers to save her parents, but instead of doing so, he used them to obliterate the prison for bounty in return. Fleeing was no option for her parents and, as such, they tragically died in a sea of fire. To this day, Auxillia has a lot of trouble dealing with this, thinking that she is the reason for his parents' alleged death.

## Tidsbits
*  The name "Auxilia" is derived from the Latin word "auxilium", meaning "aid" or "help".
