## Abilities
### Blood transfusion
Cydic can copy one of a victem's abilities by sucking some of their blood. The more blood he sucks, the longer he gets to keep the ability.

### Mosquito's bite
Can transfer over blood-related diseases from one to the other using his fangs without being affected himself. A disease must be carried over quickly for it to be effective. Depending on the severity, Cydic can also rid someone of disease in some instances.

### Toxic teeth
Cydic can secrete acids from his fangs, causing drowsiness, nausea and/or fatigue in his victims. Requires a particular good grip, which is why it's hard to bite someone in combat.

### Slashing blades
Cydic is skilled in wielding blades - from daggers to short swords.

### Hand-made cutting
When unarmed, Cydic can use his claws to attack.

## History
His ancestors, who were vampires, wanted their vampirism to be purged. Powerful magic was supposed to help them accomplish this, but a corruption in the spell caused massive, rather permanent side-effects. Whilst the serpents lost their vampirism, their fangs only grew larger, sharper. At last, a whole new kind of blood-sucking creatures was created.

Several generations later, the side-effects are just as apparent as they were back then, with Cydic currently being the youngest live member of the bloodline who inherit them. His brother, being mistaken for a vampire, was slain by vampire hunters. His sister, on the other hand, died because of a birth defect - her fangs being so long that she kept pricking her own gums, Her acid growing more acidic as she got older, she kept unwillingly poisoning herself until it became too much for her to handle.

In his youth, he was made fun of by others for his overgrown fangs. He was, among other things, being called "bloodsucker". Unfortunately for him, the name stuck. Since then, he has learned to accept it avert those of his own kind.

Cydic wants to end the bloodline, for he thinks no one should suffer the same fate as him, his brother or sister. His father, on the other hand, has other plans, believing their blood-sucking abilities are a gift of the divine. He seeks to pass it on after hearing from his only living son he didn't want to have children. Cydic wants to put an end to it before it's too late.

## Motives
*  Wants to end the bloodline, for he does not want to suffer like he, his brother and his sister have.
*  Has grown a hatred towards vampire hunters for killing his brother, mistaking him for one.
*  He resents his father immensely for prioritising the continuation of his bloodline above the well-being of his family.

## Tidsbits
*  Cydic is called after the acidic poison he and others of his bloodline can secrete from their fangs.
