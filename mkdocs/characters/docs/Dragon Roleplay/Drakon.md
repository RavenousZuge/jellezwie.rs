## Backstory
He used to be part of a communist union, but after it fell apart he lost all hope in this world and now tries to avenge it.

## Current situation 
Going around the world, hopelessly avenging anyone opposing his 'iron' fist to horde as much as possible. He tries to hord as much as possible to wait for the (inevitable) revolution to come back around, with the intent to kickstart it with massive wealth.
