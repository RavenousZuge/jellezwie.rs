**We are currently transferring from DokuWiki to MkDocs. During the transition, content on character's entry's, especially tables, may not be displayed correctly until manually fixed because of incompatibilities between the two systems. Thank you for understanding.**

This is my personal character directory site which contains all information I may use in role-playing. Use the menu bar to navigate around the site.
