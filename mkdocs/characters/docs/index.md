**We are currently transferring from DokuWiki to MkDocs. During the transition, content on character's entries, especially tables, may not be displayed correctly until manually fixed because of incompatibilities between the two systems. Thank you for understanding.**

This is my personal character directory site which contains all information I may use in role-playing. Use the menu bar to navigate around the site.

## Contributing
Some characters belong to multiple authors. If you are one such author, you may suggest changes to certain character entries using the edit button on the designated page. You will be able to make a pull request with the edits you made using your GitHub account.
